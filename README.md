Don't give extra line break space at the end in "instructions.txt" file otherwise it will give "index out of range error".

1. Run the file named "generateBin.py" (It will create a Binary file of instructions)
2. Now run the file "createTestBench.py" (It will run the instructions and show output in terminal)
